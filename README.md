About

This is a banking application designed for a specific purpose and provided as a solution.

The app is built using Wails, with Go as the backend and an SQLite database. The frontend is developed with React TypeScript, utilizing Material UI for design and Zustand for state management.

It is primarily designed to function as an offline application, but it can be extended to support online functionality with minimal additional work, if required.

Please note that some AES password keys have been modified (yes, environment variables should have been used). Although the information in the app is not highly sensitive, these changes are intended to provide an additional layer of security in case someone attempts to access the database, while still maintaining ease of use for the end user.
