This is a banking for a very specific purpose prvided as a solution.

It is a Wails app where Go is used as backend with sqlite database. Frontend is React Typescript using Material UI and Zustand. 
It is made to function as an offline app, altough it can be exteneded to work as online with little bit of work if needed. 

Some  AES password keys have been changed (yes, env should have been used). Basically due to nature of it information is not critically private but just in case to give a good hindrance if someone wants to read a database while still considering comfort of the end users.
